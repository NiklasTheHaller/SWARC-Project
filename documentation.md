# Solutions, Decisions and Risks

**Solutions Strategy**

</div>

|Goal/Requirement|Architectural Approach|

|Image Sharing/Posting|Microservice|
|Image editing / filters / third party integration of pixlr|Microservice|

<div  class="formalpara-title">

**Architecture Decisions**

</div>

|Problem|Considered Alternatives|Decision|
|---|---|---|
|Users want to post pictures in real time (1-2 seconds)|SOA: adaptive and flexible. Simpler implementation.|Microservices: SOA has issues with a sudden surge of users, we need a reliable and quick solution|
|Users want to see relevant posts|SOA: Algorithm can be updated and change without affecting the correct functioning of other services.|Microservices: Algorithm needs to quickly and dynamically adjust to user preferences through interactions (likes, comments, etc.)|
|User wants to see before & after versions of edited pictures|SOA: Saves images to database and exchanges requested data with user interface and third party services|Microservices: SOA would require many interactions with the database and be unresponsive|



<div class="formalpara-title">

**Risks and Technical Debt**

</div>

|Risk/Technical Debt|Description|
|---|---|
|Development costs|Microservices require a large team of developers to maintain, update and build the system|
|Data consistency|Microservices need to handle data independently which can lead to inconsistencies|
|Documentation|Each service requires its documentation, which can be a lot of work to update and maintain|
